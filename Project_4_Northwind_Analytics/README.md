# Northwind Analytics
## Northwind Traders is a fictitious company created by Microsoft for the purposes of demonstrating the database capabilities of Microsoft Access and then later 
for SQL Server. Since then, it has also been used by numerous companies as a sample database to demonstrate how their development tools work. In this project, I used
Northwind database to answer various business questions that may occur in real project. In this project, I used Northwind database to answer around 30 business questions
using SQL code within python.
